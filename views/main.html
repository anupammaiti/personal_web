    <p style="font-size: 18px;">   I am an undergraduate presently in my final year undergraduate. I am a fun loving guy with a wierd sense of humour(dark) and a passionate cricket fan. In my 4 years here, I have learnt a lot about life and picked up a few skills. I love dancing and I have spend 2 years of my college life dancing but I still suck a it :(. In my free time, a spent a lot of time contemplating about life. I have faced a lot of failure here in my IIT life which includes failures in subjects too. I am very interested in philosophies of life and have addressed some of them in the blogs. Despite the failures, I have learnt a hell lot through them. My mother tongue is Telugu and I'm equally proficient in Hindi and English. Navigate around the tabs and let me know if u find any bugs, Would be glad to know !!  </p>
